# Yaak Plugin API

Yaak is a desktop API client for interacting with REST, GraphQL, Server Sent Events (SSE),
WebSocket, and gRPC APIs. It's built using Tauri, Rust, and ReactJS.

Yaak plugins are written in TypeScript and executed within a NodeJS runtime. This package
contains the TypeScript type definitions required to make building Yaak plugins a breeze.

## Quick Start

The easiest way to get started is by generating a plugin with the Yaak CLI:

```shell
npx @yaakapp/cli generate
```

## Installation

If you prefer starting from scratch, manually install the types package:

```shell
npm install @yaakapp/api
```
